988	990 566317785072939008 @discerningmumin Unfortunately, real Islam, as defined in the Quran and Hadith, is too backwards and inhuman even for most ME Muslims. racism	racism
989	991 566338821449478144 @discerningmumin And since Islam declared war on all humanity. Humanity must return the favor and declare war on Islam. racism	racism
990	992 566342091349843969 @discerningmumin What are you talking about provocation? Islam declared war with the world.  That is more than enough provocation. racism	racism
991	993 566361665935912962 @discerningmumin How many Muslims there are is irrelevant. The declaration of war on mankind is clearly spelled out in Quran and Hadiths. racism	racism
992	994 566362499834843137 @discerningmumin It's Muslims that do virtually all the killing.  For example, 80% of civilians killed in Afghanistan are killed by Taliban. racism	racism

996	998 566394160173690880 @discerningmumin The hypocrisy of Islam is that they expect to convert people from other religions but they murder converts from their own. racism	racism
997	999 566394422191865857 @discerningmumin And furthermore, they murder anyone who tries to convert a Muslim, but demand the freedom to convert non Muslims. racism	racism
998	1000 566394738073292801 @discerningmumin Islam is an entire religion built on intolerance and jihad. It's time for the world to stop tolerating it. racism	racism
999	1001 566395841309450241 @discerningmumin Actually, Muslims enslaved far more than anyone else. The prophet Mohammed was a slave trader. Jesus had no slaves. racism	racism
1000	1002 566396093491998720 @discerningmumin Furthermore, the Muslims were the last to give up slavery, and many only did it under pressure from the west. racism	racism
1001	1003 566396312564682752 @discerningmumin But the western world gave up slavery on it's own. No one forced them from the outside. racism	racism
1002	1004 566396653679030273 @discerningmumin And now, every Jihadi group wants to reinstate slavery in the present because the Quran approves it and Mohammed practiced. racism	racism
1003	1005 566397020550619136 @discerningmumin So if you are against slavery, you cannot be a Muslim. So why are you crying about slavery when the Quran approves it? racism	racism

1010	1012 566406291002630144 @discerningmumin Islam is the most genocidal religion on the planet.  Mankind must exterminate Islam or be exterminated by it. racism	racism
